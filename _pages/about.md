Hi :)

I am Giovanni Briglia, since November 2024 I am a PhD student at the [National PhD in AI](https://phd-ai-society.di.unipi.it/en/),
I am working between the University of Pisa and the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia.
My focus comprehends Causal Reinforcement Learning in multi-agent system scenarios.
