Hi :)

I am Giovanni Briglia, since November 2024 I am a PhD student at the
[National PhD in AI](https://phd-ai-society.di.unipi.it/en/);
I am engaged in a partnership between the University of Pisa and the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia under the supervision of
[Franco Zambonelli](https://personale.unimore.it/rubrica/dettaglio/zambonelli) and
[Stefano Mariani](https://smarianimore.github.io/).

For more details, you can check my [cv](../assets/pdf/cv.pdf).

My focus comprehends `Causality-Driven Reinforcement Learning` in multi-agent system scenarios.
In particular, the primary goal of my research is to create a theoretical and practical framework for incorporating
causal knowledge into both model-free and model-based (deep) Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms,
in single and multi-agent systems.

Specifically, this research seeks to answer the following critical questions:

<ul>
    <li> Can we enhance the efficiency, safety, and generalization capabilities of arbitrary model-free RL algorithms by
   incorporating in action selection strategies causal models of core environmental dynamics? </li>
   <li> Can this approach be applied to any combinations of target environment, RL algorithm, and task? </li>
   <li> What is the minimal causal model necessary to achieve a measurable improvement? </li>
</ul>

Overall, the idea is that (deep) RL algorithms should focus on solving the specific problem optimally, while causal
models take care of efficiency, safety and generalisability.
