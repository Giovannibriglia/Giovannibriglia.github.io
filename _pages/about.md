Hi :)

I am Giovanni Briglia, since November 2024 I am a PhD student at the
[National PhD in AI](https://phd-ai-society.di.unipi.it/en/);
I am engaged in a partnership between the University of Pisa and the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia under the supervision of
[Franco Zambonelli](https://personale.unimore.it/rubrica/dettaglio/zambonelli) and
[Stefano Mariani](https://smarianimore.github.io/).

For more details, you can check my [cv](../assets/pdf/cv.pdf).

My focus comprehends `Causality-Driven Reinforcement Learning` in multi-agent system scenarios.
In particular, the primary goal of my research is to create a theoretical and practical framework for incorporating
causal knowledge into both model-free and model-based (deep) Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms,
in single and multi-agent systems.
Specifically, this research seeks to answer the following critical questions:

1. Can we enhance the efficiency, safety, and generalization capabilities of arbitrary model-free RL algorithms by
   incorporating in action selection strategies causal models of core environmental dynamics?
2. Can this approach be applied to any combinations of target environment, RL algorithm, and task?
3. What is the minimal causal model necessary to achieve a measurable improvement?

Overall, the idea is that (deep) RL algorithms should focus on solving the specific problem optimally, while causal
models take care of efficiency, safety and generalisability.
